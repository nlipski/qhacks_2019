# TEXT HOME project for QHacks 2019

TextHome is an easy-to-use, reliable text messaging service where users can text a designated phone number and receive directions to a desired location by text. TextHome requires only your cell-service and needs no connection to wifi or usage of any data. Users can text a place of origin and destination and then after a simple confirmation, TextHome will send an SMS with step-by-step instructions on how to get there. Users can set favourite locations -whether it be home, work, or their favourite park. It also supports an "I'm Lost Mode" where it guides the user to access the GPS coordinates from the phone, add it to the service, and provide directions.
